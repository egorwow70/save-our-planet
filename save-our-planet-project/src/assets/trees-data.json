An abundance of edible nuts are produced in autumn,  you probably know when they are ready when you see lots of squirrels in your tree. Nuts are considered to be even better than the Common Walnut (Juglans Regia). Walnuts are rounded, single-seeded stone fruits of the walnut tree. The walnut fruit is enclosed in a green, leathery, fleshy husk. The husk is inedible but the walnut seeds which are edible are a high density source of nutrients, particularly proteins and essential fatty acids. In east and central North America the commercially valuable  black walnut tree attains 30 metres in height. This species can usefully be planted in mixture with cherry or larch. In the arboretum it makes a fine free standing specimen in full light. The rugged grey bark resembles oak and the foliage is like ash.

In modern times, traditional hand picking is still quite common especially for the more delicate varieties. More commonly, farmers will use harvesters that will shake the fruit off the bush. The fruit is then brought to a cleaning/packaging facility where it is cleaned, packaged, then sold. Uses-Making blueberry jam at home Blueberries are sold fresh or processed as individually quick frozen (IQF) fruit, purée, juice, or dried or infused berries, which in turn may be used in a variety of consumer goods, such as jellies, jams, blueberry pies, muffins, snack foods and cereals. Blueberry jam is made from blueberries, sugar, water, and fruit pectin. Blueberry wine is made from the flesh and skin of the berry, which is fermented and then matured; usually the lowbush variety is used. LOOKING for that special tree - see our Arboretum section  ",

It is a good tall windbreak tree.For such a big tree, the Douglas Fir has a fairly compact canopy, with downward pointing lower branches that do a great job of blocking out sight from about 5metres off the ground when they are mature. Older trees have a very thick, corky bark with lovely sinuous ridges. Named after the plant collector David Douglas who introduced the douglas fir seeds here in 1827.  Given good soil to grow in, the douglas fir produces some of the finest timber in Britain known as Oregon pine.

    "description": "Stunning beautiful trees ! Golden indian Bean Trees (Catalpa Bignonioides Aurea trees)  is a glorious tree.  A 'must have' tree . The golden bean tree maybe slow growing at first but within 2 years you will start to see a most beautiful tree.  It will be the talking point of any garden. The large leaf is pale green when it expands, then firms up to a butter-yellow greening a little during the summer. Early autumn the leaves are back to a butter-golden yellow. Sometimes the leaves can scorch in the hot summers but will not harm the tree. The golden bean tree tends to have a lower and proportioned crown than the green leaved form. It is fair to say that the Golden Bean Tree can spread to about 4 meters wide.  Flowers that look a little like orchids will appear when more mature but does need a sunny position. Early September you may notice long seed pods which can be 20cm in length, green when young then turning a brownish/red.  An excellent specimen garden tree which may be suitable for the smaller garden. It is late coming into leaf, usually around early May and one of the first to lose its leaves. The CLEAR STEM variety means that the top has been grafted but you will have a clear stem and masses of leaves eventually that will spread out to 3 meters on top of the stem.   Eventual height 5 meters so excellent for the small garden and a good specimen for the larger garden.",
